## Introduction
**"FastTrack"** was my attempt to create my own kind of terminal. It holds personalized commands for example, open [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de) and search for Computers. But at the moment it sucks so i thought about some cool things that could transform this idea into something great and useful.
